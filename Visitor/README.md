# Visitor Pattern

## Overview
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It enables you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. This is achieved by moving the operational logic into a separate visitor class.

## Problem
When working with complex object structures, you often encounter situations where:
- You need to add new operations to existing classes without modifying them
- The operations need to be performed on different types of objects
- The object structure is stable but you need to frequently add new operations
- You want to keep related operations together in a single class

## Solution
The Visitor pattern solves this by:
1. Creating a Visitor interface that declares visit methods for each type of element
2. Creating concrete Visitor classes that implement these visit methods
3. Adding an accept method to the Element interface that takes a Visitor
4. Implementing the accept method in concrete Elements to call the appropriate visit method

## Structure
- **Visitor**: Interface that declares visit methods for each type of Element
- **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the Visitor interface and contains the actual operations
- **Element**: Interface that declares the accept method
- **ConcreteElement**: Implements the Element interface and calls the appropriate visit method

## Example Implementation
```cpp
// Visitor interface
class Visitor {
public:
    virtual void visit(ConcreteElement& element) const = 0;
};

// Element interface
class Element {
public:
    virtual void accept(Visitor& visitor) = 0;
};

// Concrete Element
class ConcreteElement : public Element {
public:
    void accept(Visitor& visitor) override {
        visitor.visit(*this);
    }

    void operation() const {
        std::cout << "ConcreteElement did operation\n";
    }
};

// Concrete Visitor
class ConcreteVisitor : public Visitor {
public:
    void visit(ConcreteElement& element) const override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteVisitor visits ConcreteElement\n";
        element.operation();
    }
};
```

## Use Cases
1. **Document Processing**: When you need to process different types of document elements (text, images, tables) with various operations
2. **Compiler Design**: For operations like type checking, code generation, or optimization on different AST nodes
3. **GUI Components**: When you need to perform operations on different UI elements
4. **Game Development**: For operations on different game objects (rendering, collision detection, etc.)

## Benefits
1. **Open/Closed Principle**: You can add new operations without changing the element classes
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Related operations are grouped in a single visitor class
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new operations by creating new visitor classes
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Algorithm logic is separated from the object structure

## Drawbacks
1. **Breaking Encapsulation**: Visitors often need access to internal details of elements
2. **Complexity**: The pattern can make the code more complex and harder to understand
3. **Maintenance**: Adding new element types requires updating all visitor classes
4. **Performance**: Double dispatch mechanism can impact performance

## When to Use
- When you need to perform operations on a complex object structure
- When you want to add new operations without changing the element classes
- When the object structure is stable but operations change frequently
- When you want to keep related operations together

## When Not to Use
- When the object structure changes frequently
- When performance is critical
- When the element classes need to maintain strict encapsulation
- When the operations are simple and don't justify the pattern's complexity

## Implementation Notes
1. The Visitor pattern uses double dispatch to determine which visit method to call
2. Elements must implement the accept method to allow visitors to visit them
3. Visitors must implement visit methods for each type of element they need to handle
4. The pattern works best when the element hierarchy is stable
